                    July 30th, 2023 - walked up to the bus stop with cat food in hand (classic), saw you standing, shot my shot with a cringe "have we met before?" ðŸ’€ somehow managed to convince you to come see my cat (serial killer behaviour fr but it worked). you wouldn't drink my tea tho lmao can't blame you. you also destroyed my score in chess, played god tier music, and almost dipped without giving me your number... but left a cat doodle on my fridge instead. that was enough for me
